This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) uses for style
- [@daisyui](https://daisyui.com/) uses for card style
- [@react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) uses for icons

## I have declared 4 state in my project. I used two array state and 2 number state in my project. like -Api calls, -cart selection, -total price and -credit hour adding and remaining credit hour.
